###WordPress Sugar
I can not take any credit for this at all, the Sugar was orginially created by [Alison Barrett](http://alisothegeek.com/) for [MacRabbit](http://macrabbit.com/)'s all in one editor [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/).

It was released for Espresso 1 back in [2010](http://alisothegeek.com/2010/02/wordpress-template-tags-auto-complete-sugar-espresso/) and now updated for Espresso 2 in [2011](http://alisothegeek.com/2011/02/new-wordpress-sugar-for-espresso/) thank to continued [support](http://www.sinestesia.co/)

So why is it here?
Simple I could not get the autocomplete to work so I thought I'd have a look under the covers, it never hurts to have enough code on GitHub I guess.
